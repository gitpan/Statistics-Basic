   - I'm skipping the t/60_ tests without recent versions of
     Math::BigFloat.  No idea what causes the problems, but since
     the module isn't required, it doesn't even tell me the
     version of the module.
   - Perl's locale support is embarrassingly buggy.  Under
     certain conditions, Number::Format will die because perl's
     POSIX getlocale stuff returns some (but not all) of certain
     locales.  This stuff is reproducible on almost any
     machine, so I didn't bother to report it.  WRW installed a
     fix in NF 1.61(a) that sets the thousands_sep to "" when
     it's the same as the decimal_point.  Fixed (sorta).

1.6001: Thu Nov  6 07:06:24 EST 2008
   - noted the population vs sample issue (again)

1.6: Sun Oct 19 07:24:19 EDT 2008
   - rather than fixing more of the tests using
     abs(blah-blarg)<tolerance, I've moved to overload '==' to do
     it for me iff $ENV{TOLER} is set to a tolerance.
   - I rather trivially allow Math::BigFloat inserts, but this
     isn't documented or tested well.

1.531: Thu Oct 16 16:26:12 EDT 2008
   - A really minor bugfix thanks to Michiel van Loon
   - I'm also requiring the latest version of Number::Format to
     see if that mysterious separator problem disappears for
     the rare tester that has a problem with it.

1.53: Fri Aug 22 17:34:02 EDT 2008
   - did some cleanup on the recalc code
   - still showing a bug in the new t/08_filter tests... 
   - yeah, bad bug in the median code, wow

1.50: Fri Aug 22 06:56:17 EDT 2008
   - adding a computed vector class that will act just like a
     vector, but will be recomputable.
   - computed vectors and a test have been added...
   - added a filtered-outlier test
   - documented the new computed vectors

1.00: Thu Aug  7 07:24:36 EDT 2008
   - finished up the docs, they still need to be proofread

1.00: Fri Aug 1 - Wed Aug 6 2008
   - bringing this distro up to date, apparently people actually
     use it.
   - tons of doc fixes
   - adding an overloader class to deal with "" and 0+
   - pre-reqed in Number::Format for ""
   - forget returning undef cardinality, vector sizes are 0 when
     they don't have a size set.
   - added vector tags and the ability to add "computers" linked
     to other vectors
   - renamed CoVariance to Covariance
   - I modernized and updated the crap out of the vector class
   - I tested most of that new stuff also
   - I added the "computer" storage devices to the Vector class
   - I started the new smarter linking
   - fixed an unimportant memory leak with Scalar::Util::weaken()
   - re-wrote the docs from scratch

0.42:  Wed Jan 25 17:22:11 EST 2006
   - jettero patched in Orien's things

0.41.3:  Thu Mar 25 12:48:56 EST 2004
   - jettero took out the stoopid mod::sig, everyone hated
     it anyway

0.41.1 and 0.41.2: Tue Mar 23 07:59:46 EST 2004
   - Copyright clarifications.  ... GPL with a twist.

0.41:  Fri Jan 30 08:54:37 EST 2004
   - jettero found an amazingly STUPID typo in the Basic.pm
     Statisics anyone?

0.4:  Thu Jan 29 11:20:51 EST 2004
   - jettero added the UNBIAS flag for those that wish to
     use (N-1) in their variance. Perhaps I should switch
     the default. We will see.

0.39:  Fri Dec 12 07:18:18 EST 2003
   - jettero changed the NAME field to match CPAN

0.38:  Tue Dec  9 08:35:59 EST 2003
   - jettero discovered many bugs in the insert/ginsert of
     the new new()s

0.37:  Mon Dec  8 20:58:08 EST 2003
   - jettero cleaned up the new() functions so they don't
     require arguments for no reason

0.36:  Sat Dec  6 11:32:17 EST 2003
   - jettero added (linear) LeastSquareFit

0.35:  Tue Dec  2 17:04:58 EST 2003
   - jettero was working on the documentation in Basic.pm
     when he realized the need for ginsert and set_vector
     around the world... finished implementing those.

0.34:  Tue Dec  2 14:45:11 EST 2003
   - jettero tought the ::Covariance module to take ::Mean
     objects as optional arguments to keep the ::Correlation
     object from uselessly recalculating the mean as
     mentioned in the entry below in 0.33.

0.33:  Tue Dec  2 14:00:48 EST 2003
   - jettero did an amazing amount of work on the objected
     oriented structrues, the tests in t/ and added the
     queuing functions to the packages. He also added the
     Vector object to handle some things. Note that the
     author is aware that the Mean get's uselessly
     recalculated for some the high level objects...
     Solution forthcomming...

0.25:  Mon Dec  1 12:13:44 EST 2003
   - jettero installed a correlation module and upped the
     version a great deal.

0.02:  Mon Dec  1 00:28:50 EST 2003
   - jettero made some base packages, namely: StdDev,
     Variance, Covariance, and Mean.

0.01:  Sun Nov 30 11:55:03 EST 2003
   - jettero made a skeleton package
