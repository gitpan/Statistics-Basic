=head1 NAME

Statistics::Basic::Mean - find the mean of an array

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Invoke it this way:

    my $avg = mean(1,2,3);

Or this way:

    my $v1  = vector(1,2,3);
    my $avg = avg($v1);

And then either query the values or print them like so:

    print "The mean of $v1: $avg\n";
    my $mq = $avg->query;
    my $m0 = 0+$avg;

Create a 20 point moving average like so:

    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("select col1 from data where something");
    my $len = 20;
    my $avg = mean();
       $avg->set_size($len);

    $sth->execute or die $dbh->errstr;
    $sth->bind_columns( my $val ) or die $dbh->errstr;

    my $count = $len;
    while( $sth->fetch ) {

        $avg->insert( $val );
        if( -- $count <= 0 ) {
            print "Mean: $avg\n";
        }
    }

The full details are probably in the base module.  If you have questions, just
let me know.
