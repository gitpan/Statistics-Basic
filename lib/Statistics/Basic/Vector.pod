=head1 NAME

Statistics::Basic::Vector - a class for handling arrays of numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Invoke it this way:

    my $vector      = vector(1,2,3);
    my $same_vector = vector($vector);
    my $different   = $vector->copy;

This module tracks which of the other L<Statistics::Basic> modules I<use> it.
That's it's primary purpose.  It does have interpolation though...

    print "$vector\n"; # pretty printed

The full details are probably in the base module.  If you have questions, just
let me know.
